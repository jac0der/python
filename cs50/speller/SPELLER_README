Speller is used to read the lines from a file to creat a dictionary
which may be checked for the existence of words. The length of the 
dictionary may also be obtained to check the size of the dictionary.

The files provided as dictionaries are:
    1. small
    2 large

A python set is used to represent the dictionary, as a set contains
only unique values.

This implementation shows the ease of which a higher level language
such as python may accomplish such a task as compared to a lower level
language such as C.
