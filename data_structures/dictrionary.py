'''
    A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.
    Each key is connected to a value by a colon (:),
    and I can use a key to access the value associated with that key.

    A dictionary is used to represent/connect related pieces of data for objects.
    such as: List of words and their meanings
             List of people names and their favorite numbers
             List of mountains and their elevations etc...
